# Greetings from Finixbit ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel, a Senior Software Engineer and Security Researcher with several years of experience in Ghana. 

- I'm most comfortable with backend engineering and extensive security research in Python. Though over the years I've professionally worked with C/C++ and Clojure.
- My focus in the last 4 years has been building ETL frameworks/toolings and Security Research specifically Autonomous vulnerability discovery.
- I've sometimes led and managed teams at (Pavelon, etc), and also an individual contributor at (Civis Analytics, etc).

## Things I'm interested in

- Data Engineering, (worked on [async-graph-data-flow](https://github.com/civisanalytics/async-graph-data-flow))
- Data Integrations (worked on ETL frameworks and Data Pipelines at [Civis Analytics](https://www.civisanalytics.com/))
- Security Research, Program Analysis, Compiler toolings
- Debuggers Internals (worked on [print-function-args-debugger](https://github.com/finixbit/print-function-args-debugger), [ftrace](https://github.com/finixbit/ftrace))
- C/C++, Python, CPython Extensions ([worked on A CPython extension to convert PHP OpArray bytecode to Python Object](https://github.com/finixbit/php-bytecode-security-framework))
- GCC (specifically with [Gimple IR](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GIMPLE))
- Hacking PHP Internals (specifically Zend Bytecode) 
- Ghidra, P-Code, Ghidra Python API
- Simplifying Thought Representations 
    - Words serve as a wrapper for thoughts. Consider the phrase `'Red car'`, instantly your mind constructs an image of a red car within your mental space. This mental imagery occurs even if there isn't a physical red car in your immediate surroundings. 
    - Thoughts essentially manifest as mental images of words, shaped by your perspective or understanding. The ability to simplify thoughts in any field enhances your understanding and strengthens your imagination in that area. 
    - If you'd like to delve deeper into this topic, feel free to connect with me below.
- Spiritual, Christian 
    - Certain ideas and imaginative realms can only be accessed through higher dimensions. 
    - Consider the example of [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras), who ventured to Egypt to study and engage in spiritual practices alongside Egyptian priests. 
    - This trend extends to historical scientists, including figures like Isaac Newton and Galileo, all of whom possessed a certain spiritual understanding.)
